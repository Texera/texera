     * JoinPredicate joinPre = new JoinPredicate(Attribute idAttr, Attribute
     * descriptionAttr, 10) <br>
     * will create a predicate that joins the spans of type descriptionAttr of
     * outer and inner operators (that agree on the idAttr id attributes) and
     * outputs tuples which satisfy the criteria of being within 10 characters
     * of each other.
     * </p>
     * 
     * <p>
     * Given below is a setting and an example using this setting to use
     * JoinPredicate (consider the two tuples to be from two different
     * operators).
     * </p>
     * 
     * Setting: Consider the attributes in the schema to be idAttr (type
     * integer), authorAttr (type string), reviewAttr (type text), spanAttr
     * (type span) for a book review.
     * 
     * Let bookTuple1 be { idAttr:58, authorAttr:"Bruce Wayne", reviewAttr:"This
     * book gives us a peek into the life of Bruce Wayne when he is not fighting
     * crime as Batman.", { "book":<6, 11> } }
     * 
     * Let bookTuple2 be { idAttr:58, authorAttr:"Bruce Wayne", reviewAttr:"This
     * book gives us a peek into the life of Bruce Wayne when he is not fighting
     * crime as Batman.", { "gives":<12, 18>, "us":<>19, 22} }
     * 
     * 
     * where <spanStartIndex, spanEndIndex> represents a span.
     * 
     * JoinPredicate joinPre = new JoinPredicate(idAttr, reviewAttr, 10);
     * <p>
     * 
     * <p>
     * Example 1: Suppose that the outer tuple is bookTuple1 and inner tuple is
     * bookTuple2 (from two operators) and we want to join over reviewAttr the
     * words "book" and "gives". Since, both the tuples have same ID the
     * distance between the words are computed by using their span. Since, the
     * distance between the words (computed as |(span 1 spanStartIndex) - (span
     * 2 spanStartIndex)| and |(span 1 spanEndIndex) - (span 2 spanEndIndex)|)
     * is within 10 characters from each other, join will take place and return
     * a tuple with a span list consisting of the combined span (computed as
     * <min(span1 spanStartIndex, span2 spanStartIndex), max(span1 spanEndIndex,
     * span2 spanEndIndex)>) given by <6, 18>.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Example 2: Consider the previous example but with words "book" and "us"
     * to be joined. Since, the tuple IDs are same, but the words are more than
     * 10 characters apart and hence join won't produce a result and simply
     * returns the tuple bookTuple1.
     * </p>
     * 
     * @param idAttribute
     *            is the ID attribute used to compare if documents are same
