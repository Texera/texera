Texera Helm Chart has been installed!

{{- if .Values.persistence.enabled }}
PERSISTENCE CONFIGURATION:
This deployment uses persistent volumes for PostgreSQL and MinIO data.

{{- if .Values.persistence.removeAfterUninstall }}
- PVs and PVCs will be automatically deleted by Helm during uninstall
{{- else }}
- PVs and PVCs have the "helm.sh/resource-policy: keep" annotation
- They will NOT be automatically deleted during helm uninstall
- Data will be preserved between installations
- The volumes are stored at: /mnt/data/{{ .Release.Name }}/ on the host

If you want to completely remove the persistent data:
1. Uninstall the helm chart: helm uninstall {{ .Release.Name }}
2. Manually delete the PVs and PVCs:
   kubectl delete pvc postgresql-data-pvc -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}
   kubectl delete pvc minio-data-pvc -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}
   kubectl delete pv postgresql-data-pv
   kubectl delete pv minio-data-pv

Alternatively, you can set persistence.removeAfterUninstall=true in values.yaml to let Helm delete them.
