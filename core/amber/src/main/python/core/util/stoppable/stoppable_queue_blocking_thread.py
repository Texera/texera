class StoppableQueueBlockingThread(Thread, Stoppable):
    """
    An implementation of Stoppable, assuming the Thread.run() would be blocked
    by a blocking Queue.get(block=True, timeout=None).

    For example:
    ```
        def run(self) -> None:
            while True:
                entry = queue.get() # here is a blocking Queue.get()
                # do something with the entry
    ```

    According to https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html#queue.Queue.get, which
    quoted as: "Prior to 3.0 on POSIX systems, and for all versions on Windows, if
    block is true and timeout is None, this operation goes into an uninterruptible
    wait on an underlying lock."

    Currently, there is no other workaround for interrupting a waiting stoppable, safely.

    This implementation adds a special marker called
    `StoppableQueueBlockingThread.THREAD_STOP` into the queue, and when the marker is
    consumed, it should break the Thread.run().
